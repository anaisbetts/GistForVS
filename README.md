## Gist for Visual Studio

This is a Visual Studio add-in that enables posting Gists directly from Visual
Studio. To use it, open a text editor window, select some text, then move your
mouse over the Gist window at the top right of the editor.

## Alpha as-is code, doesn't actually work

I haven't finished this, due to a frustrating Assembly Load bug in Visual
Studio (VS will *sometimes* throw while loading the add-in, very difficult to
debug). However, several people were interested in this as a starting point,
so I'm releasing it so others can hack on it if they're interested.

In other words, don't judge me on the quality of this code :)
